# "Moderno" a Firestore implementation using Kotlin

You can use this application as a reference for implementing Frestore.
## Getting Started
You can use this library either by downloading the drawing pad module or by importing it directly as shown below.
## Import
**Sptep 1.** Add jitpack to your root `build.gradle`:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
**Step 2.** Add the dependency:
```gradle
dependencies {
     implementation 'com.github.appitiza:SignatureApp:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```


### Usage
#### To use the signaturepad
Copy the below code to use signnaturepad

```
<net.appitiza.android.drawingpad.drawpad.views.SignatureView
        android:id="@+id/signature_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        attr:clearOnDoubleTap="true"
        attr:penColor="@android:color/holo_blue_dark"
        attr:penMaxWidth="9dp"
        attr:penMinWidth="5dp"
        attr:speedimpressionWeight=".1" />
```

You can use attributes to adjust the features of signature pad
Example 
```
        attr:penMaxWidth="9dp"
        attr:penMinWidth="5dp"
```
With above code, you can adjust the pen width
